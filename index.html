            <p>
              I based the color scheme of this website on those Chinese red
              envelopes that people usually give to their younger relatives on
              Chinese New Year when I was designing the wireframe of this
              website on Figma.<br /><br />I utilized React's useState and
              useEffect hooks to implement a functionality to the website that
              changes the values of the props that are being passed into the
              components depending on the time of day.<br /><br />You can see an
              example of that on the video playing at the home page and on the
              menu listed of the right side of the "food trip" tab's
              restaurants.<br /><br />You can explore Binondo by clicking this

          <div class="text">
            <p>
              Made with the three main colors of The Bunny Cafe's logo in mind,
              a shade of orange named #f06c53, a shade of black, and a shade of
              white named #fefefe. <br /><br />
              I designed the hero page and the 'Meet The Buns' page in Figma on
              how their layouts would look like. The full-width background image
              with a heading and a subheading for their tagline, including the
              linklist of their social media accounts below.<br /><br />To
              achieve what I had designed, I used Bootstrap to create the navbar
              and the cards for the bunny profiles but I did my own styling. I
              have used the fonts, Cabin for most of the text but used the font,
              Salt and Pepper for the brand name and the names of the bunnies,
              which I only integrated to the website upon asking my boss.<br /><br />You
              can check out the buns by clicking this

              Modeled after what I call the "The Miami Nightclub" aesthetic.<br /><br />
              For its design, I utilized a shade of pink named #ff69b4 for text
              emphasis, a shade of black named #171321 for the background color
              of the "Projects" and "About" section, a shade of blue named
              #2b3871 for the body background color, and a shade of purple named
              #4b0d49 for the "Contact me" section.<br /><br />
              I used the fonts, "Newsreader" for the header texts and "Tiro
              Gurmukhi" for paragraph texts. I've also added links throughout in
              the form of spans and icons that change styles when you hover over
              them. I've also created a navbar that redirect you to a section of
              the page itself or links to another website when clicked.

              Originally programmed to be played in the console, I went back and
              added graphics and added styling like effects applied when the
              hover pseudo-class is triggered once I have learned about
              JavaScript's DOM Manipulation and Selectors.<br /><br />
              This is the first project that I have applied all three of the
              fundamentals of web development, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br /><br />

              Made with the similar design of this portfolio website in mind<br /><br />I
              created a 3x3 grid to simulate the Tic Tac Toe gameboard and
              written a loop that selects each of the squares, in order to put
              down the player's turn inside. I gave the AI opponent the same
              moves but I set a timeoiut in order to simulate the AI thinking
              about its next move.<br /><br />A selection screen for the player,
              whether they like to play as 'X' or 'O' is also included and upon
              clicking either of the buttons, the selection screen will fade out
              and the gameboard will fade in<br /><br />I have also made the
              winning logic of the game, wherein if 3 of the same symbols match,
              the player or the AI will be declared the winner by the gameboard
              fading out and the victory screen fading in complete with a
              'Replay' button to bring back the selection screen on.<br /><br />You
